# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on making the Quantum Job Tracker application production-ready for hosting. The application is a full-stack job tracking platform with a Node.js/Express backend, React frontend, MongoDB database, and various integrations (Google OAuth, Razorpay payments, email services). The deployment preparation involves configuring environment variables, optimizing build processes, setting up proper security measures, creating deployment configurations, and ensuring the application can run reliably in a production environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure proper environment variables and secrets management, so that the application can run securely in production without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN sensitive data is needed THEN the system SHALL load it from secure environment variables
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
4. IF any required environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with a clear error message
5. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use secure session and cookie configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the frontend build process, so that the application loads quickly and efficiently for end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL create optimized, minified frontend assets
2. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL enable proper caching headers
3. WHEN the frontend is built THEN the system SHALL generate a production-ready bundle with code splitting
4. WHEN assets are served THEN the system SHALL compress files for faster loading
5. IF the build process fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the backend for production deployment, so that it can handle production traffic securely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use production-grade middleware configurations
2. WHEN handling CORS THEN the system SHALL only allow requests from authorized domains
3. WHEN serving the application THEN the system SHALL serve the frontend static files from the backend
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL bind to the correct port for the hosting platform

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create deployment configuration files, so that the application can be easily deployed to various hosting platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to cloud platforms THEN the system SHALL include platform-specific configuration files
2. WHEN using containerization THEN the system SHALL include a properly configured Dockerfile
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include health check endpoints
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling configurations
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear deployment logs and error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper security measures, so that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL implement security headers and middleware
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
3. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL implement proper Content Security Policy
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure session management
5. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL disable development-only features and debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up proper logging and monitoring, so that I can track application performance and debug issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL log important events and errors
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture error details for debugging
3. WHEN serving requests THEN the system SHALL log request information for monitoring
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for analysis
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create startup and build scripts, so that the deployment process is automated and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL execute frontend and backend builds in the correct order
2. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL run database migrations if needed
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate the environment configuration
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL verify all components are properly built
5. IF any build step fails THEN the system SHALL stop the process and report the error
