At IBM Quantum, our mission is to bring useful quantum computing to the world. IBM brings the most performant quantum computers and enables the quantum community to develop early quantum computing use cases with the Qiskit software stack. Today, our IBM Quantum Network comprises 275+ Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions, national laboratories, and startups, all striving toward the common goal of extracting value from quantum computers. IBM is driving this technology forward along an ambitious roadmap aimed at demonstrating quantum advantage by end of 2026, delivering the first fault-tolerant quantum computing by 2029. We hope you'll join us on this mission.
Your role and responsibilities
We are seeking a passionate and technically skilled Quantum Developer Advocate to join our team and help grow and enable a vibrant ecosystem around our quantum computing platform. This role sits at the intersection of enablement, education, and community engagement—ideal for someone who thrives on explaining complex concepts, supporting researchers and developers, and accelerating adoption of quantum computing.
As a Quantum Developer Advocate, you will work closely with quantum researchers, software developers, educators, and the open-source community. You’ll represent the voice of users internally and bring the company’s latest capabilities to the world through workshops, events, tutorials, and more. In this role, you will take the lead in advancing some of our workforce development and community initiatives in collaboration with our partners in the EMEA region, with a particular focus in Spain. 
This role will give you the opportunity to shape the quantum education strategy across multiple ecosystems. You must be passionate not only for technology but also for connecting people and seeing individuals grow within our community. The ideal candidate must also possess communication skills appropriate for engaging scientists and developers while teaching complex concepts to a technical audience. You will liaise with numerous internal and external stakeholders and tackle complex problems which will often involve several teams, while still being able to operate independently to prioritize tasks effectively.   
  Develop tailored strategy to deliver unique and scalable quantum education programs adapted to our partners and local communities’ needs.
Drive IBM Quantum’s workforce development initiatives for educators, researchers, developers, and students.
Deliver technical lectures for a wide audience, ranging from beginners to experts.
Constantly enhance your quantum computing knowledge to build a diverse portfolio of lectures and tutorials based on the latest Qiskit tools and features.
Collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to define and achieve goals.
Stay up to date with the latest developments in the quantum computing field, both within IBM and externally.
    Key Responsibilities
·       Educate and empower partners and regional ecosystems to use real quantum computers using Qiskit through high-quality tutorials, workshops, and example quantum algorithms and applications.
·       Engage with academic and developer communities online (GitHub, Discord, Slack, forums) and in person (hackathons, challenges, developer conferences and meetups).
·       Collect feedback and pain points from users and relay actionable insights to engineering and product teams.
